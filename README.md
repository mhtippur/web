I am a PhD student at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) working with Professor Edward H. Adelson in the [Perceptual Science Group](https://persci.mit.edu/). My current research explores the development and use of tactile sensing to improve dexterous robotic manipulation. I have also had the opportunity to work with Professor Pulkit Agrawal ([Improbably AI Lab](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/)), and I am grateful to have been supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship ([NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the MIT MechE Chang-Mansfield Fellowship. 

Previously, I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Electrical Engineering. During my time there, I was fortunate enough to work on a variety of soft robotics and biomedical engineering projects, advised by Professor Frank Hammond III ([ARM Lab](https://armlab.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech), Professor Cynthia Sung ([GRASP Lab](https://sung.seas.upenn.edu/people/sung/) at UPenn), and Professor Robert Butera ([Neural Engineering Lab](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Robert-Butera) at Georgia Tech). I also spent time at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as a Caltech WAVE Fellow.
